# Detailed description

Summary:
- Talk about virtual machine introspection in Xen: how it is implemented,
  what its current limitations are, and how said limitations contribute
  to security standing (e.g. by inhibiting debugging). Possibly have a
  section on points of improvement, e.g. implementing monitoring in PV mode
- Technical specifics to touch on: foreign memory mapping & grant tables,
  HVM event monitoring, xenctrl (used in lots of ways inspecting & manipulating
  VMs), possibly how dom0 issues commands to Xen (some kind of virtual device)
- Currently I know a fair amount about VMI, but I'm not sure what topics would
  be interesting to people / worth talking about. This is my biggest issue at
  the moment...
